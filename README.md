# 01-html-git-css - HoriSEOn
Working with the customer, Horiseon, to take their existing website code and bring it inline with HTML 5 semantic structure.

## On the job ticket
```
The customer approached me with thier existing website code, requesting it to be brought inline with accessability standards, for SEO optimization - see below:
```

### User Story

```
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The main challenge i faced, was the use of non semantic code structure in the HTML and over use of class selectors in the CSS file. I overcame this by breaking down the code line by line and reorganzing into the correct semantic structure, for SEO optimization and accessability standards

I hope to optimize further in the future, with the use of flex-box and media queries to make the site accessible across multiple devices and screen sizes.

```

## Using the code
```
I have been careful to log notes within the HTML and CSS files to document the changes made, so that others can easily understand the changes made, when potentially having to collaborate on the code.
